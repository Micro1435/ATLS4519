##Summary
I had a good idea for this project but Android is a lot more confusing than iOS so I have uploaded several different attempts at creating this app.

####Cars_1
This is the most basic version I have right now.  All it has are preset cars in a list view.  If you click on one, it will open a new activity with a picture of the car.  The "Add Car" Button opens a new activity to add a car but it doesn't do anything.
